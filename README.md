# Custom-Adventurers
A base for creating custom adventurers for Necropolis

# Creating Custom Adventurers
creating a custom adventurer is as easy as making a new creature entry in Creatures.csv however you MUST prefix the ID with PC otherwise the game may crash and/or your character may not be able to equip any armors you create for it. all you have to do after that is create an Adventurers.txt file and put the ID of your adventurer in it

# Adding Multiple Custom Adventurers

At the moment you will need to manually add new Adventurer IDs to an existing Adventurers.txt

## IMPORTANT

if not all players have this mod installed you will have issues. if using this make sure everybody in your lobby has it installed!
